# UX Heuristic Review

**Scope**: Hero, USP, IntakeCTA, Contact sections

## 1. Hero Section
- CTA Bekijk mijn diensten label generic, lacks urgency or benefit  
- Dual CTAs compete for attention; primary secondary hierarchy unclear  
- Hero copy strong but second CTA phone icon size and label styling similar to primary  
- On mobile CTAs stack can feel bulky  

## 2. USP Section
- No CTA; opportunity to drive user to service details  
- Text-heavy grid with no interactive element or link  

## 3. IntakeCTA Section
- Single telephone CTA limits conversion options (no form or scheduling link)  
- White button on colored background good contrast but ARIA labels and focus styles missing  

## 4. Contact Section
- Email button styling low contrast against background  
- Lacks descriptive labels such as Email us  

## 5. Navigation and Flow
- Navbar lacks persistent CTA such as Plan intake  
- Scrolling journey lacks direction indicators or progress hints  
- No trust or social proof near CTAs to reduce friction  

## Recommendations
- Simplify CTA hierarchy and improve benefit-oriented copy  
- Add contextual CTAs in USP and Process sections  
- Introduce a scheduling form or modal for IntakeCTA  
- Improve accessibility: ARIA focus and contrast  
- Add analytics attributes and heatmap tracking
